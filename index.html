    <h2>Eclipse Restaurant</h2>
    <p>I was originally hired at Eclipse Restaurant in the Delmar Loop, St. Louis to be a hostess. I showed an aptitude
        for recognizing fake IDs and was then trained as a "door person"...essentially a bouncer. Relevant info: I was a 
        22-year-old, 5'6", rail-thin girl. This isn't usually what you picture when you think of a bouncer. Nevertheless,
         I turned out to be pretty effective at my job. Most people who tried to cause a physical altercation were males,
          and very few dudes want to be the guy who beats up a "little girl" who told them they couldn't come into a bar.
        <br><br>
        I worked at Eclipse and the associated Rooftop Terrace Bar as a door person for several years and would still 
        occasionally pick up a door shift until I had my son last year. During my time working for Joe Edwards, I also
        worked at a bar in The Grove neighborhood.

    <h2>Handlebar</h2>
    <p>After it came to light that Joe Edwards was uncomfortable with a female on his door security team, I gained a job at 
        Handlebar in The Grove. Not having to wear a uniform and being able to stand outside smoking all night while I did my job 
        with a bunch of really fun people turned out to be a much better fit for me. Eclipse had also made a name for itself as very 
        strict on fake IDs, so we stopped fielding as many. Handlebar was far enough away and scores of fakes came through each week. 
        As an added bonus, I earned a bounty on every fake I confiscated as a thanks for keeping underage drinkers out of all of the 
        bars in The Grove.

    <h1>Some Fakes Basics</h1>
        <center><p>If you don't have full knowledge of fake IDs, here are some ways a layman can recognize them.</p></center>
    <br>
    <h2>Microprinting</h2>
    <p>Each ID has very small lines of teeny tiny text. If you look closely you can make out individual letters and words. These letters 
    should be crisp and uniform in size.</p>
    
    <h2>Photoshop</h2>
    <p>Most makers of fake IDs have you take a photo at home and send it in to them. Then they replace the background of your photo with 
        standard DMV blue. This leads to extra crisp lines around the person's head, and strangely placed or incorrect shadows. Check for 
        these things if you suspect the ID might be a fake.
    </p>

    <h2>Card Material</h2>
    <p>Lots of fake IDs are printed on cheap plastic. If you gently fold a real ID in half, the lamination will remain sealed to the card. With 
        a fake ID, the lamination will often bubble up away from the fold line and can generally be peeled away from the corners of the card.
         An older or very cheap fake ID may snap in half altogether. If you can easily break or ruin an ID, it's almost probably a fake.
